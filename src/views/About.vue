                    After graduating college I quickly realized that my money was ending up in a lot of different places.
                    I found it difficult to keep track of my investments, so I created VuFi to do it for me.
                    It worked pretty well, so I decided to share it with the world.
                    The app is my passion project, so you can rest easy knowing that when you contact VuFi support, you'll be talking to the CEO and Founder of the company.
