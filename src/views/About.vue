                    After graduating college and getting my budget under control, I quickly realized that my money was ending up in a lot of different places.
                    I like being organized, and I hated the idea of losing track of my investments.
                    So after trying to maintain a spreadsheet and realizing how much of a hassle it is to check all my accounts manually, I created VuFi to do it for me.
                    It worked pretty well, so I decided to share it with the world.
                    The app is a one man operation; I'm not a big company, but you can rest easy knowing that when you contact VuFi support, you'll be talking to the CEO and Founder of the service you're using.
